Once upon a time, there lived a David in a Seattle . Her life was scrumptious , a continual stream of slow 
activities. Everyday, she went to the Wallingford . It was a place where he could ran by herself. Then, everything changed. 
She met several ants . Together, they ran all over the world. One luscious day, they returned to 
her original Lakeside . Everything had joder . Thus, she left, never to return. This nicely mad-lib was written by 
Aidan O'Neill.
